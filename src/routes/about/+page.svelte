	<p>
		This is a shameless ripoff of the NYT's <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/games/connections"
			>Connections</a
		> game. It was built for fun, and to let people create their own puzzles. All credit for the game
		design itself to the NYT games team.

	<h3>Why are the game urls so long?</h3>
	Because that's where the game itself is "saved"! When the app runs, it decodes that long string into
	the grid of words and their categories. If you'd like, you can use a link shortening service to make
	your game easier to share.
